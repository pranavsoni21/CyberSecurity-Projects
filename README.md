# About Me

Hi, I’m Pranav Soni. I’m a PJPT-certified cybersecurity enthusiast and currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree from Chandigarh University. With over two years of hands-on practice in CTFs, labs, and security challenges, I’ve worked to sharpen my skills in penetration testing and problem-solving. I’m also ranked among the top 1% of users on TryHackMe.

Alongside cybersecurity, I like creating small projects and tools in python. Outside of tech, I’m passionate about reading books and enjoy sports like cricket, football, and badminton.
